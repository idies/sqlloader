The transformation from linear flux measurements to asinh magnitudes

magnitude at high signal-to-noise ratio, but to switch over to linear behavior at low S/N and even at negative values of flux,

Stored as <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">petroMag</b></font>. For galaxy photometry, measuring flux is more difficult than for stars, because galaxies do not all have the same radial surface
brightness profile, and have no sharp edges.  In order to avoid
biases, we wish to measure a constant fraction of the total light,
independent of the position and distance of the object. To satisfy these
requirements, the SDSS has adopted a modified form of the
Petrosian (1976) system, measuring galaxy fluxes within a circular
aperture whose radius is defined by the shape of the azimuthally
averaged light profile.<algorithm>mag_petro</algorithm>

<def>
The Pogson magnitude is the standard astronomical magnitude system, where one 
increment in magnitude is an increase in brightness by the fifth root of 100.
A star of 1st magnitude is therefore 100 times as bright as a star of 6th magnitude. Mathematically this is expressed as<br>
<code>M1 - M2 = -2.5log(F1/F2)</code><br>
where M1 and M2 are the magnitudes of two objects, and F1 and F2 are their luminous fluxes.

An azimuthally-averaged radial

units of maggies<glossary>maggie</glossary> per square arcsec. The number of annuli for which there is a
measurable signal is listed as <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago"> nprof</b></font>, the mean surface
brightness is listed as <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago"> profMean</b></font>, and the error is listed as
<b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago"> profErr</b></font>.  This error includes both photon noise, and the
small-scale "bumpiness" in the counts as a function of azimuthal
angle.
<br>
When converting the <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">profMean</b></font> values to a local surface
brightness, it is <b>not</b> the best approach to assign the mean
surface brightness to some radius within the annulus and then linearly
interpolate between radial bins.  Do not use smoothing
splines, as they will not go through the points in the cumulative
profile and thus (obviously) will not conserve flux. What frames pipeline<glossary>frames_pipeline</glossary>

lines of constant nu<glossary>nu</glossary>, with no east or west boundaries. 
Scanlines touch but don't overlap, and thus are a unique mapping on the
sky for that stripe only.  Scanlines for different stripes DO overlap. This is because the scanlines come from the camera columns, or camcols<glossary>camcol</glossary>, which

angle, measured relative to row and column of the CCDs. This is equivalent to the normal definition of position
angle (east of north), for the scans on the equator. The performance of the Stokes parameters are not ideal at low
signal-to-noise ratio, in which case the adaptive moments<glossary>adaptive_moment</glossary> will be more useful.

<def>
A strip is a scan along a line of constant survey latitude eta<glossary>eta</glossary>. The center of a stripe is set at a given eta; centers of strips have a boresight<glossary>boresight</glossary> offset added. Because the columns of CCDs have gaps between them, it is necessary to take two offset but overlapping observations to fill in a stripe<glossary>stripe</glossary>. These two scans<glossary>scan</glossary> are called strips. Note that while strips are centered on a given eta, THEY ARE NOT BOUND BY ETA LINES. Thus they are rectangular regions. and can overlap at the poles.

<keyword>stripe</keyword>
<entry>stripe</entry>
<def>
Stripes are the sum of two strips, defined in survey coordinates<glossary>survey_coords</glossary> (lambda<glossary>lambda</glossary>, eta<glossary>eta</glossary>).  A "stripe" is
defined by a line of constant eta, bounded on the north and south by
the edges of the two strips that make up the stripe, and bounded on
the east and west by lines of constant lambda. Because both strips and
stripes are defined in "observed" space, they are rectangular areas
which overlap as one approaches the poles. <b>NOTE</b>: You may see the term stripe used to mean an area
bounded by eta lines, which would be a unique part of the sky. That is
a common use of the term, as some of the target selection
documentation uses it that way. The proper (and relatively new) term
for the unique, eta-bound portion of a stripe is a stave<glossary>stave</glossary>.

<keyword>surface_brightness</keyword>
<entry>surface brightness</entry>
<def>
The frames pipeline<glossary>frames_pipeline</glossary> also reports the radii containing 50% and 90% of the Petrosian flux<glossary>mag_petro</glossary> for each band, <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">petroR50</b></font> and <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">petroR90</b></font> respectively. The usual
characterization of surface-brightness in the target selection pipeline of the SDSS is the mean surface brightness within petroR50. 
<br>
It turns out that the ratio of petroR50 to petroR90, the so-called "inverse concentration index", is correlated with morphology (Shimasaku et al. 2001,
Strateva et al. 2001). Galaxies with a de Vaucouleurs profile have an inverse concentration index of around 0.3; exponential galaxies have an inverse
concentration index of around 0.43. Thus, this parameter can be used as a simple morphological classifier. 
<br>
An important caveat when using these quantities is that they are not corrected for seeing. This causes the surface brightness to be underestimated, and
the inverse concentration index to be overestimated, for objects of size comparable to the PSF. The amplitudes of these effects, however, are not yet well
characterized.

<keyword>survey_coords</keyword>
<entry>survey coordinates</entry>
<def>
One of the two main coordinate systems used by the 
survey, with coordinates eta<glossary>eta</glossary> and lambda<glossary>lambda</glossary>. 
This is simply another spherical coordinate system, where (eta,lambda)=(0,90.) corresponds to (ra,dec)=(275.,0.) and (eta,lambda)=(57.5,0.) corresponds to 
(ra,dec)=(0.,90.). Note also that at (eta, lambda)=(0.,0.), 
(ra,dec)=(185.,32.5). So, this is a pure rotation of the usual RA/Dec system, as opposed to the great circle system<glossary>great_circle_coords</glossary>, which is defined relative to each individual stripe<glossary>stripe</glossary>.
For some reason, although "eta" is constant along great 
circles, it is referred to as "survey latitude," while "lambda" is referred to
 as "survey longitude." Also, "eta" runs only from -90. to 90.; the back of 
the sphere is covered by "lambda", which runs from -180. to 180. The Survey 
coordinates are defined such that the "primary" area of a stripe<glossary>stripe>
</glossary> (otherwise known as a stave<glossary>stave</glossary>) in the north 
is defined by a rectangle in Survey coordinates which is 2.5 degrees wide in 
eta (coordinate width). You may be interested in SM routines which convert 
between Equatorial, Survey, and Great Circle coordinates.
Again, Astrotools<glossary>astrotools</glossary> has routines to do this as well.
